This repo is to store notes and potentially work on the effectiveness of methods that look to ascertain cell-specific DNAm effects in EWAS.

`[methods-list.xlsx]` contains a list of the different methods with their PMID, paper title, first author, corresponding author + email, and how the method can be implemented.

Notes on the different methods from their respective papers can be found in the `[notes]` folder.

`[previous work]` contains work done by a summer student of Matt's that assessed how well TCA and HIRE tend to estimate actual cell-types.
